This branch contains modifications to the mozilla:release branch for compiling
the Record Replay gecko based browser.

### Getting started:

**macOS**

1. Make sure that you are using Python v2.7
2. `cp mozconfig.macsample mozconfig`
3. Download `MacOSX11.1.sdk.tar.xz` from https://github.com/phracker/MacOSX-SDKs/releases
4. untar `MacOSX11.1.sdk.tar.xz` in the repo root to create a `MacOSX11.1.sdk` directory
5. run `./mach bootstrap` and select (2) Firefox Desktop
6. run `node build`
   * On Apple Silicon, you many need to run `RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=qcms node build` to build successfully.
7. run `./mach run`

**Linux**

1. `cp mozconfig.linuxsample mozconfig`
2. run `./mach bootstrap` and select (2) Firefox Desktop
3. run `node build`
4. run `./mach run`

### Troubleshooting Tips

* If you change your PATH to point to a different version of say Python or Rust you need to rerun `./mach bootstrap` to get the build system to pick up the change.

### Merging from upstream

1. Checkout the `release` branch, pull from upstream `release` branch:

```
git checkout release
git pull https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev.git release
```

2. Switch to a new branch, merge from the `release` branch.

```
git checkout webreplay-release
git checkout -b replay-merge
git merge release
```

3. Fix merge conflicts.
4. Fix build breaks.
5. Make sure the output binary is `replay` and not `firefox`.
6. Get e2e tests etc. to pass.
7. At this point it is reasonably safe to merge into the `webreplay-release` branch.

```
git checkout webreplay-release
git merge replay-merge
git push
```

8. Update geckoVersion in the backend.
9. Make sure automatic updates work with the new browser. Deploy a browser but do not release it, then open it, open "About Replay" and see if it updates.

Tips for debugging:

* Look at the update server logs to make sure requests are being processed correctly.
* Set the `app.update.log` browser config when running, and then check console output.
* If there is a line like `*** AUS:SVC readStatusFile - status: failed: 23, path: /path/to/update.status`, this is produced by the C++ updater which can be found in `UpdateThreadFunc` in `updater.cpp`. Building a local browser with instrumentation is likely needed to investigate.

10. Run live test harness and make sure crash rate is acceptable.


### Miscelleneous

Speeding up oh-my-zsh

```
git config --add oh-my-zsh.hide-status 1
git config --add oh-my-zsh.hide-dirty 1
```
